            Tim Berners-Lee, born 1955, was a British computer
            scientist most known for his invention of the World
            Wide Web, URLs, and the coding language HTML. After
            he graduated, he would soon become a consultant at
            CERN, where he created a program named Enquire that
            could store information in files that contained
            connections both wthin and out files, soon being
            renamed to hypertext. Later, he started developing
            procedures that allowed computers to communicate with
            each other.
